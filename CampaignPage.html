    <td><center>There are so many people struggling to get treated for the chronic diseases they have been disgnosed. I have a cousin in Mexico who just got diagnosed with Leukemia. His family had to sell some property. They even had to pawn items like jewelery, cars, tractors, etc. They had to do all of this because they have to rent the machine that is used for chemotherapy. The public insurance that most of the population uses doesn't cover care for chronic diseases. Which leaves people to try and collect as much money as possible just so they can pay for something that should be covered by insurance agencies.
